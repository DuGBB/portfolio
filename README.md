## 02 Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

Week ones challenge goal was to create a website portfolio from scratch.  

I did this by:
-making my name highly visible 
-including a recent photo  
-including links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
-including links in the navigation that makes the UI scroll to the corresponding section
-when you click on the link to the section about my work
then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the my applications
-making my first application larger then the following ones
-when you click on the images of the applications
then you are taken to that deployed application
-using flex to help make the page fit screens of different sizes
